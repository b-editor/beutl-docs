这篇文章将会解释如何修改一个元素或者对其进行更多的操作。  

## 基础概念

This page uses terms such as __Source Operations__ and __Drawing Objects__. For more details, please refer to [this document](../advanced/1.rendering-process.md).

## Adding Effects
First, select the element you want to add an effect to on the timeline. The properties of the selected element will be displayed in the __Source Operations__ tab on the right side.

To add an effect directly to a drawing object, click the `+` button in __Filter Effects__ and choose the effect you want to add.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the effect you want to add from the library to __Filter Effects__.

Dragging and dropping elsewhere will add the effect as a source operation.

## Transformations
Using transformations, you can express movement, rotation, scaling, distortion, and more.

To set a transformation directly on a drawing object, click the `+` button in __Transform__ and choose the type of transformation you want to add.

For the move transformation only, you can move it with the mouse from the preview screen. However, move transformations added as effects (or source operations) cannot be moved with the mouse.

## Editing Element Timing
You can edit the start time and duration of elements by dragging them with the mouse on the timeline.

To simplify editing in Beutl, elements will snap to the timing of other layers during dragging. To temporarily disable this feature, hold down the `Alt` key while dragging. This feature __cannot be permanently disabled__ in the settings.

## Splitting Elements
You can split elements by right-clicking the element you want to split on the timeline and clicking the split button in the menu. You can also use the `Ctrl + K` shortcut to split the selected element at the current frame.

## Making Elements Easier to Identify
In Beutl, you can change the color and name of elements. These can be changed from the right-click menu.

You can change the name by pressing the `F2` key or double-clicking the element.
