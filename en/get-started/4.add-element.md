There are three ways to add elements to a created project/scene.

## Method 1
- Drag and drop the type of element you want to add from the library to the desired position on the timeline.

## Method 2
- Right-click on the desired position on the timeline.
- Click __Add Element__ to add.

![](_images/4.add-element/timeline-right-click.mp4)

In this method, an empty element is created, so you need to drag and drop the drawing objects such as video, image, and text from the library later.

## Method 3
- Drag and drop the video, audio, or image file you want to add to the desired position on the timeline.
