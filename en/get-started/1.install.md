## For macOS

Download and extract `Beutl.osx_arm64.app.zip` or `Beutl.osx_x64.app.zip`.
You should see a warning like this:
![](./_images/1.install/macos-gatekeeper.jpg)

This warning appears because I have not signed the application.
To bypass this, run the following command:
```sh
xattr -rc Beutl.app
```
