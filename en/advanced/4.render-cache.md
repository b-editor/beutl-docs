description: Explanation of render cache generation in Beutl

## Cache
Consider the following nodes.
```
1. Render Node
2. └ Transform Node
3. 　 └ Effect Node (Drop Shadow, with animation)
4. 　 　 └ Effect Node (Outline)
5. 　 　 　 └ Shape Node
```
Transform Node and Shape Node have no animation.

In conclusion,
In this example, after a few frames are rendered,
Beutl will cache up to the 4th effect node.  
Below is an explanation of why this happens.

## Determining Cacheability
If the same state persists for 3 or more frames, it is considered cacheable.
During node rendering, a count is maintained, and if the node changes, the count is reset to zero.
When this count reaches 3 or more, it is considered **cacheable**.

If a node is **cacheable** and all its child elements are **cacheable**,
the rendering content of that node is cached.
