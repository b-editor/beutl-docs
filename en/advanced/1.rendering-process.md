## Elements
Elements are placed on the timeline and evaluated in order from the top.

When evaluated, elements create drawing objects through source operations or transform those drawing objects.

The created drawing objects are then passed to the drawing layer after applying animations.

## Drawing Objects
Drawing objects include ellipses, rectangles, rounded rectangles, videos, etc.

Properties include:
- Transform (move, rotate, scale, etc.)
- Pen
- Fill
- Effects

## Source Operations
Source operations can completely change the incoming drawing object into a different object or modify its properties.

## Drawing Scene / Drawing Layer
A scene or layer that does not consider the timeline.
A drawing layer can contain multiple drawing objects, and similarly, a drawing scene can contain multiple drawing layers.

When a drawing layer receives drawing objects from elements, it creates drawing nodes as follows:

The drawing layer tracks changes to the drawing objects and recreates drawing nodes if changes occur.
```
1. Drawing Node
2. └ Transform Node
3. 　 └ Effect Node
4. 　 　 └ Shape Node
```

These drawing nodes are executed in order from 1.

This structure is very useful for caching drawing content.
For example, applying a heavy effect to an object and animating it to appear from off-screen would normally apply the heavy effect every frame.

By caching the object after the effect is applied, the effect only needs to be applied a few times.
```
1. Drawing Node
2. └ Transform Node
3. 　 └ Draw cached image
```
